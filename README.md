# OCamlProblems
Collection of problems solved in OCaml. This is a functional programming
language that I had learned while I was an exchange student at McGill University.
These small file programs were written in 2017 while I was reviewing the language.
I do not have much experience with functional programming, but I am pretty excited
about it and trying to learn more.
